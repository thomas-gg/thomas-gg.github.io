My name is Thomas Garry. I'm an aspiring software engineer who loves learning! Recently I've been getting into learning guitar from youtube tutorials like this. I am definitely not at that level yet as I haven't had official training and got my guitar about a year ago, but one day I will be. I absolutely love the sound of the acoustic guitar and fingerpicking. Most of the time I end up learning just the chorus or just playing a certain part of the song, but here are my favorite songs to play:

- I'd love to change the world, Ten Years After
- You've Got a Friend in Me (fingerstyle), Randy Newman
- Blackbird, The Beatles
- Dream a Little Dream (fingerstyle), Doris Day
- Simple Things You Do, Michael Carreon
- Corduroy Dreams, Rex Orange County
- Married Life (from my favorite Pixar movie, Up), Michael Giacchino  
- The Night We Met, Lord Huron

Yep, I have a very strange song preference. I also played soccer for a little over half of my life now, so running/sports definitely hold a special place in my heart as well.
